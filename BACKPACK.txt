This is a backpack of scripts we can share with eachother. I made this so you can copy this into your code so you don't have to ask me or redo it :)

The cooldown doesn't work :( Oof

-------------
Cooldown: 

```
last = db[str(msg.author.id)]["game_cooldown"]
now = datetime.now()
cur = now.strftime("%S")
can_go = False
if last == None:
  db[str(msg.author.id)]["game_cooldown"] = cur
  can_go = True
else:
  last = int(last)
  cur = int(cur)
  if cur > last + 20 or cur < last: # Change the 20 on this line to your seconds of choice
    can_go = True
  else: can_go = False
# Use can_go to see if the user can proceed or not
```
